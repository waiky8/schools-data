# schools data
For those interested in schools data such as ratings, performance and what good schools there are in your area. Currently, the best way is to utilise data provided by ofsted. I used **beautiful soup** to crawl their website and made use of their available csv files, putting them through **panda dataframes**.

I used **ETL** to extract the relevent data and stored them into **mysql** - I found **mysql workbench** to be very handy during testing. New datasets can also be loaded with minimal work.

So that's the data part. The next phase will be visualisation.
